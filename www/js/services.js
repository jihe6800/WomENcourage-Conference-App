Over centuries we relied on drawing and sculpture to convey shapes. However, these tools require significant expertise and time investment, especially when one aims to describe complex or dynamic shapes. With the advent of virtual environments one would expect digital modeling to replace these traditional tools. Unfortunately, conventional techniques in the area have failed, since even trained computer artists still create with traditional media and only use the computer to reproduce already designed content.',

The students will be introduced to programming, basic electronics, circuits and how to enable/disable LEDS programmatically. The students will be hands on to learn the basics of a Galileo computer board and the steps for programming the board using Arduino and ArduBlock. The students work in teams of 2 to execute the hands on exercises for the workshop. Students aged 9 to 13 are ideal participants.'],

This workshop will introduce you into the world of interactive electronic circuits. They can be attached on clothing and can intelligently communicate with the human body. Do not hesitate! Everyone can participate: students, researchers, fashion designers, developers, or just curious people. All the materials and toolkits for making your first prototype are provided by the organizer! Moreover, the best projects can win some wearable electronics materials and toolkits! If you are interested, hurry up! We have only 20 places!
