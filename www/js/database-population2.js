Nowhere is such a computing goal more evident than in the field of accessibility where we seek to create devices and software to address needs of people who have disabilities. In creating accessible technology and novel accessibility tools, research has not only facilitated digital interactions and quality of life needs for many, but also has served to advance the field of computing more generally. The needs of users can and should inform the agenda for emerging research in areas such as augmented memory, physical interactions, and human communication.'],

    location: 'Main Aula',
    description: ['How do you succeed in the area of computer science? My research has shown that having grit is more important than IQ or any other personality trait, and that grit together with the student\'s overall view of success matters the most. If you work hard, and do not give up when it is really tough, then you are likely to have a good career in any subject, including computer science. However, if you are a woman in computer science success also correlates to you handling the male dominated field, and being the token figure. This can be seen as another kind of grit. The norm of the field is connected to the computer science nerd who has no interests but technology, and that this personality trait is required to be a part of the community. In this keynote I will tell some of my stories about how it is to be a woman in the field, and give some insights into the kind of grit that it requires to be a successful token figure.'],

Open Source projects can be very rewarding, both for the people who use the products and for the people involved in the project.

Fortunately, with open source software, you can gain experience during your spare time with freely available tools and resources.',

        'The organizers will provide a small open source project for you. You can join the project and start contributing in a tightly controlled environment. You\'ll learn how to submit bug reports, contribute improvements, and get involved with a project.',
        'All of this will be done within our own project with just the workshop attendees involved. We will work over IRC (Internet Relay Chat) & Mailing Lists to resolve bugs and contribute to the project.',

    description: ['Despite our great expressive skills, we humans lack an easy way of conveying the 3D shapes we imagine, even more so for dynamic shapes that change over time. Over centuries we relied on drawing and sculpture to convey shapes. However, these tools require significant expertise and time investment, especially when one aims to describe complex or dynamic shapes. With the advent of virtual environments one would expect digital modeling to replace these traditional tools. Unfortunately, conventional techniques in the area have failed, since even trained computer artists still create with traditional media and only use the computer to reproduce already designed content.',
        'Could digital media be turned into a tool, even more expressive and simpler to use than a pen, to convey and refine both static and dynamic 3D shapes? This would make shape design directly possible in virtual form, from early drafting to progressive refinement and finalization of an idea. To this end, models for shape and motion need to be redefined from a user-centered perspective. This talk will present our recent work towards "responsive shapes", namely high level models that take form, refine, move and deform based on user intent, expressed through intuitive interaction gestures.'],
